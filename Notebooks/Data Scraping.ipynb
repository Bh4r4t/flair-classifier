    "# Reddit Data Scraping\n",
    "To make a Reddit Flair classifier first we need to have the data for analysis and then fitting data into model. Inorder to grab the data from the subreddit ```r/india```, I will be using the reddit API. Although earlier I came up with other ideas as well, to scrape.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Praw (Python reddit API Wrapper)\n",
    "To start working with praw it, requires that the user should have an active reddit account and knows basic working of reddit.<br>\n",
    "First set up the reddit api and set up the credentials, we'll be using those to use praw and get submissions<br>\n",
    "Now use the credentials and set up the praw. use the subreddit attribute to get set the api to fetch submissions from a particular subreddit, here in our case it is ```india```.\n",
    "\n",
    "Praw provides us to get the submissions sorted in order of ```top```, ```hot```, ```new```, ```rising```. So I will fetch the data from all of these, along with a constraint that there should be no duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the drawback of praw is that the limit to fetch submissions is 1000, so one way is to get 1000 posts from each of sorted data, but there are many duplicates, so at the end the data is not enough for analysis and for training.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Psaw (PushShift API Wrapper)\n",
    "With psaw I can get the any amount of data. This stores all the reddit submissions as soon as they are pushed onto the reddit wall. But the ratings ans number of upvotes, comments are not updated at realtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "But with psaw the data fetched is not good, in terms of post's rating and comments as these values are not good at the time of post pushed into the database of pushshift."

F**k history. They may call us Nazis who cares, life is more important than fake image.\" [1]\\n\\nRangoli Chandel was followed on Twitter by over 100 thousand people. The tweet remained for everyone to see for almost a whole day. It was retweeted 1497 times and liked by over 5600 people.\\n\\nLast year, in the wake of the Pulwama attack, Kangana Ranaut had said this of Shabana Azmi and Pakistan:\\n\\n\"The film industry is full of such anti-nationals who boost enemies\\' morals in many ways, but right now is the time to focus on decisive actions. Pakistan\\'s ban is not the focus, Pakistan\\'s destruction is.\" [2]\\n\\nEarlier this year, the Indian government awarded Kangana Padma Shri, the country\\'s 4th highest civilian honor. \\n\\nFollowing this latest incident, if not a Padma award, it is entirely plausible that Rangoli could at least snag a BJP ticket in an upcoming election. \\n\\nJai Hind.',\n",

       "       \"1- when India gained independence, we start seeing the private company as British East India successor so to many restrictions on the company to work. company start giving bribe to make progress in their work which starts the system of merchant-politics.  \\n2- We Indian start worshipping farming as the main tool to remove poverty, not as a tool to fill the stomach of Indian. which start system to give everything free to the farmer and stop the market hand in farm product. \\n\\nIn 1960, when India has widespread drought, a new system to store food come into India by which government start to buy cereal from the farmer and distributing it.\\n\\n  problem with it is that Farmer starts selling the crop to the government but how much government can buy and distribute it (there are 1960 35kr people in India, you can't reach to everyone with that level of technology). so left out farmers sell their crop in one time, which decrease the price of the crop . Also due to this system, there is no need for food storage by the farmer so no one makes new storage it other than the government.\\n\\n3-In India there is the problem of the people mentality -\\n\\nit's so where when people started to make fun of Pakdoanomics nad Teanomics, it is job from where main uplifting of poor come into the market. how many people and story you know where father sell tea and pakdoa and parethe and chat, son become food store chain owner. \\n\\n in my village neighbourhood, one man comes from Mumbai and start a Badapav stall at Chopal about 2 years ago today he give work to his 3 brothers and move out to city to open stall, at the chopal 5 new food stall open, seeing his success.\\n\\n today important to more people come into the food-stall industry with there liquid (money) to give people Job because in production and farming job are decreasing . and government cant stomach both much-needed infrastructure whose cost are many-fold increases due to the price of land and a government job for people.\\n\\n4-Culture  of office - in India job is only related with, to dream with an office with too much file. so why will normal people want to do the manual job? so manual job become poorest people work with that there work price decrease, with low budget come you death which all time happen in India.\",\n",

Google RSS ideology. If you agree then it wouldn't matter if someone explains some things here, if you disagree than that's our problem. They don't respect gandhi, they never raise indian flag on independence day, they don't respect constitution because it was written by a dalit(have you even seen a dalit head of rss shakha? Do you know any prominent member of rss who isn't uppar caste hindu?). RSS is a demak of this country. A species of maggots which only flourish and multiple when the society is rotten and motherland is dying.\\nAnd why they walk around with talwars and lathis? Don't they trust police or they have their own motivation? Have you ever seen an organisation in the world which is so called sewak of janta and parades with guns and talwars? Only terrorist organisations does that. Every terrorist organisation has its followers in their little part of the world like ISIS. While other world can see the bigger picture. The world sees what they're doing, not what they are saying. That's why RSS has always been recognised as armed terrorist organisation by CIA. *Hizbul mujahideen in Kashmir*\\n\\n ( They think they are fighting for their land, their religion, they are the protectors of the culture, screw westernization thoughts, radical in nature, can beat up and kill people when found in groups)\\n\\n*RSS in India* \\n\\n(SAME) Believing primacy of hindhi/sanskrit over other Indian languages.\\n\\nBrahmin supremacy - all but one RSS heads has been Brahmin. RSS only exists to maintain Brahmin and then other upper caste privileges.\\n\\nNo steps towards Hindu reforms. All the reforms have been done externally, like Brits banning sati, Ambedkar empowering lower castes, DMK letting non-Brahmins become priests and removing need of Brahmin priest to officiate marriage.\\n\\n\\nBring from TN, I am wary of RSS especially cause I don't want my state to become hate infested, upper caste dominated backward region. [How the deceitful RSS incites Hindus into violence against Muslims](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H41rpN6Etsw) Hate for RSS in contemporary times is a reaction against the hateful ideas, actions and mentality spread by RSS and its fans over last 3 decades. Against multiple sections of society - muslims in the early 90s, christians in the late 90s through 00s, muslims again this decade, against leftists and centrist liberals throughout, against the ideas of liberalism and secularism.\\n\\nRSS has been around from the 20s but before the 90s, it was seen as just a fringe far right loony group and largely ignored. It's possible some academics and intellectuals disliked it based on its ideology alone or its pro-colonial stand during 30s and 40s,  rather than for its actions. But now, many people judge RSS not through their theories or utterances of their chiefs, but the intolerant violent actions on the ground of their affiliates and fans.\\n\\nEdit: Oh, and of course their involvement in M.Gandhi's assassination. It's not a reason for the hate I think, but it did - and continues to - make them look distasteful in the minds of many Indians. For people who claim to represent all hindus, they don't have any dalit leaders, also I have never seen any RSS activists come out to protect intercaste couples considering RSS proclaims itself as the guardian of Hinduism.\\n\\nSo imo it's a upper caste Hindu organization which pretends to care for all hindus but will turn on Dalits and tribes once they get rid of Muslims\",\n",

       " \"You need to know how your local grocery does their transactions with wholesellers. Does your grocer go to a godown, load things into a van and drive it to the retail shop? Does he get that stuff delivered? Does he or someone close to him personally  exchange cash with a wholeseller? Those things make a difference. If your grocery makes deal on the phone/online and takes deliveries through a separate loading area with no physical  interaction, then you are better off going to a grocer.\\n\\nIf not, delivery is safer. Delivery people usually make shorter trips since cooked food is perishable and needs to be warm on arrival. It is therefore very likely that your delivery person has just gone around within a small area of a few sq kilometers. Someone making delivery of raw/packaged food items to retail shops usually cover longer distances across several localities.\\n\\nSo if there is a covid-19 hotspot 10 kms away, you are more likely to get it through your grocer than through your doorstep. If you do no-contact delivery with electronic payment and basic hygiene, the risk becomes pretty low. Zomato earlier said the driver delivered for them too. Best option is to ask the delivery guy to leave the items outside. Maybe leave a bag. Once he leaves, leave it for a few hours. If that is not possible, take it and immediately disinfect the containers/packets using IPA/soap water/vegetable wash.\\n\\nIf possible, dump all the outer cartons/packaging outside your house in a garbage bin. Wash the bag in a washing machine and make sure to disinfect yourself as well after all this is done.\\n\\nThis is the protocol I've been following myself. We can't avoid deliveries in these times. It is far safer than going to the market and buying there where you have no control over the surroundings.\",\n",

It sets a standard for good behaviour and punishes the bad. To majority of people, this aspect of moral compass reinforces their belief in right and to some it act as a deterrent against going bad.

Among those tested, India has a much lower positive to negative ratio than most other countries, which is surprising because India had a much more stringent criteria for testing (only symptomatic individuals with recent foreign travel history or contact with a confirmed lab-positive individual) People crying \"abuse of statistics\" here is hilarious.\\n\\nThis is the statistic that tells you way more than tests per capita. It is nonsensical to claim this is \"misrepresentation\".\\n\\nIndia is only testing the highest risk individuals and amongst those the negative to positive ratio is higher than almost all countries.\\n\\nIf anything, widespread testing will **increase** this ratio further. I would like to add that you can\\'t use test per million or total tests for any country or region because it\\'s a stupid metric. Tests per positive case is a far better metric.\\n\\nTest per million will tell you that Delhi with test per million 822 is doing better testing than Kerala with test per million of 483. It will also tell you that Kerala is doing far worse testing than Italy with test per million of 18481.\\n\\nTest per million ignore a very simple thing i.e. the number of known cases. Consider two countries having the same population 1 million each having done 10000 tests. Tests per million will say that both countries are doing exactly equal job at testing. But even if in country A, cases are 5000 and in country B cases are 500 then tests per million will ignore that. The country with higher cases obviously will see a higher growth in cases (exponential growth). So, if next day, country A will have 500 additional cases, country B will have only 50 additional cases. But even if both countries are doing 500 tests each day, the test per million metric will say both countries are doing equally good job. But the truth is that to detect those 500 cases, country A will need to do far more tests than country B needs to detect those 50 cases. \\n\\nJust for the record, when Italy had 12464 known cases (which was on 11th March), it had done 68774 tests (~18% positive). When India had a similar number of known cases i.e. yesterday, we have done over 2,70,000 tests (~4% positive). At that time Italy was doing ~12000 tests/day when we are doing around 28000 tests. But test per million will say that Italy with tests per million of 18000 is doing a fabulous job compared to India\\'s ~200.\\n\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_Italy\\n\\nEdit- Around a month back, I had a long discussion on why test per million makes no sense. I will copy paste from that as well.\\n\\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fm9bbx/20_march_2020_india_is_still_far_behind_other/fl37ryo/\\n\\n>Let me explain it in another way.\\n\\n>Consider 2 countries- country A and B, both having same \\'r\\' - same population density, social organisation, seasonality etc.\\n\\n>Country A has 1000 known cases and they have done 2000 tests\\n\\n>Country B has only 100 known cases and they have also done 2000 tests.\\n\\n>Both the countries have a population of 1 million. Which countries no. of known cases you think should be more close to actual cases.Tests per million in both the countries is 2000 tests per million. I will give you two options-\\n\\n>(a) Both the countries have same tests per million and hence in both the countries, number of known cases should be very close to actual cases\\n\\n>(b) Country B is doing better because in country A, positive test rate is 50% (2000 tests, 1000 positive) but in country B, positive test rate is 5% (2000 tests, 100 positive). This means that country A has a very strong criteria of testing and it\\'s not testing as many people as it should and hence it\\'s actual numbers should be way above it\\'s known number.\\n\\n>Am I making sense that why tests per million is irrelevant?\\n\\n\\n----\\n\\n>Let me try another way.\\n\\n>10 days ago, we had maybe 20-30 known cases. How many tests we should have done then to capture most actual cases? Lets say you did some calculations of your own and you said 500.\\n\\n>Today, we have 300 cases. How many tests we should have done till today? Will your answer still be 500? Of course not. You would probably say 10000 or 15000 or something like that.\\n\\n>Now, in these 10 days, has India\\'s population changed? Not by a lot. Maybe marginally. But your answer may change from 500 tests to 15000, no? This is because no. of tests you need to do will change with time in sync with actual cases\\n\\nEdit-Italy was doing 12000 tests per day and not 2500. 2500 was the number of cases per day. What can I infer from this? If they dont test enough IMO.. post lockdown there will be an explosion of cases. Read a couple of articles which states many dead people being brought in hospitals with covid like symptoms are not being investigated at all. Lockdown period should have been utilized to the full in order to carry out contact testing. However we missed the boat when international travellers(air/ water) were not fully vetted and quarantined in a methodical way! (edit open: when we claimed capacity of 50k-70k testing per week!edit close) People with no history of travel started having positive test results in early march., which mean community spread might have started then. Now if we arent testing on war footing... there will be many cases un noticed, post lockdown it may explode. So post 14 days of incubation period there maybe many carrying the virus who may have passed it on, changes are once lockdown is lifted scenario can be scary.. This is actually a very thought out PR response. India is definitely doing way lower tests than what\\'s advisable. Like way lower. A certain political leader might be dumb but his statement at face value is absolutely correct. We ARE NOT doing enough tests by a mile.  \\n\\nThis disease has a slightly lower trend in India because of potentially two reasons , heat and humidity decreases the R0 of the virus and BCG vaccines which although not proved in a peer reviewed study yet might be slowing the progress of the disease. Combine this with the fact that most elderly in india tend to stay indoors meant that before the lockdown many elderly who would have increased the death toll by a huge amount stayed safe. \\n\\nHere\\'s the murky part, it doesn\\'t matter what the \\'trend\\' of the spread of the infection is. You can only find a \\'trend\\' when you have tested enough people. I am in Maharashtra, in Mumbai , I know for a fact they are not testing nearly as much as they should. Their excuse for this is \\'Random sampling\\' another phrase no one from the press is going to question. Random sampling is only statistically useful if you have a large enough sample size. Ie - testing 100 people randomly in a district of 300k people does nothing. \\n\\nThink about it yourself, there are many of you fellow redditors here who might be a part of a community where random testing was done. You really think checking 800 samples in the entire state of Maharashtra is a big enough sample size for a state where the population is larger than that of Germany? There is a reason why global headlines aren\\'t mentioning the number of tests india is carrying out at all. If our methods were indeed a 4d chess move to checkmate the spread then other countries wouldn\\'t have relied on extreme levels of testing. I am currently living in a cluster of 50k people where. No one has even attempted to test anyone. My neighbour might be having a flu right now which might turn out to be covid19 or worse I might be having the disease right now and be asymptomatic entirely and no one will find out. \\n\\n\\nTldr -\\n\\n1 in 24 turning out to be positive is a localised trend. It will be more in hotspots and less in relatively better areas. Without proper testing we won\\'t find the overarching national trend. Hell we won\\'t even be able to find half of the hotspots. \\n\\nPs - despite all that I said ICMR knows this as much anyways , they just don\\'t want to create a situation where people think they are underhanded. I mean India has way more people than Germany with a fourth of the infrastructure. This is currently the best method we have sadly. However once we do get test kits I hope it changes. The disease does have a low mortality rate but it\\'s still adds up when the total number of infected also rise. The lockdown has kept the potential number of deaths to an all time low and at the very least testing has slowly been increasing in some of the worst hit states (unlike others like WB and North eastern states) . One thing ICMR and the govt has been able to do is to contain the number of deaths (it depends on Viral load as well) lockdown ensures at the very least if people do get exposed a small exposure may not even cause symptoms.\\n\\n\\n\\nEdit - got some very good responses , half expected comments to be _ahaha Modi good u bad_ however let\\'s just let it play out and hopefully get over this completely by year end, this year has been absolutely garbage, hope everyone stays in good health and get through this. If we have enough tests we should start testing everyone who is symptomatic at this stage, never mind the travel history. Because like half the people who have virus will be asymptomatic anyway. \\n\\nDunno if we can even afford that. Then why is the death rate so high? [deleted] That invariably could also mean you are testing less. Learn your fractions man. Also based on actual case fatality rates the number of undetected infections is probably higher; undetected because of low testing.',\n",

Also being a professional photographer is not the same as being interested in it. The grind can make you start hating it tbh. I honestly would say stick to a career where you can make money and keep photography on the side. Spend at least 4-5 years as an ametuer and see if you still enjoy. Use the money you earn to get better gear. Imo professional photography nowadays depends on not only your own creative talent,but your ability to reach out and connect to people. In other words get out there!And  make sure to maintain a good portfolio.Oh and also patience,lots and lots of patience.\\n\\nAnd no,you do not need a degree of any sorts(Many good photographers are self taught).

       " \">\\tAs the crisis worsened in China and then spread to Italy and Iran in January and February, the Modi Government was distracted first with the Delhi election campaign, the Trump visit that followed shortly thereafter, and finally the communal flare-up in the national capital. The first inkling we received that the Prime Minister was paying any attention at all to the pandemic was when he tweeted on March 4 that he would not be celebrating Holi and advised the country to follow social distancing norms as advised by the medical community. This should have been all the warning anybody needed to desist from continuing their socialising, but as we were to find out, many people, especially those in responsible positions, continued their high-flying social schedules and strutted around as though they were immune from the virus. India was learning a lot about itself during this trying time.\\n\\n>\\tThis was when the BJP indicated its political priorities by pulling down the Congress party's Madhya Pradesh Government by engineering the defection of Jyotiraditya Scindia; this took precedence over all other matters, even a burgeoning pandemic. It is no coincidence that the Modi Government began to take concrete steps towards a lockdown only after the Kamal Nath Government fell on March 20. At least a week, if not more, of invaluable time was lost there, but there is no doubt that the lockdown was necessary and there was no disagreement on that part. The manner in which the lockdown was executed is another matter, however, especially in the treatment of migrant workers in major cities who were left stranded in limbo without a livelihood or the ability to return to the sanctuary of their villages as a result of the sealing of state borders. Just like demonetisation, it seems there had been close to no preparation before the Prime Ministerial pronouncement, though ironically the experience of enduring the ordeal of demonetisation did in some ways mentally prepare the country for the lockdown.\\n\\n>\\tThis was when the most extraordinary thing happened. The political leadership of the country basically disappeared into their residences. Nobody self-quarantined with more rigour and intent than the Union Council of Ministers. Apart from the occasional appearance of the Prime Minister in his video conferences, for three weeks, the face of the Modi Government was a dour Joint Secretary from the Health Ministry who held forth in a daily presser where his unsatisfactory answers to basic questions from the journalists present became more and more apparent as the number of infections in India began to peak. Apparently, there is still no community transmission in India. You know who passed this evolution, of therr country,  the SK leadership.\",\n",

We let too many idiots and abusers propagate their views with no societal checks.\\n\\n\\nif you are polite and calm,people will say \"yeh tho chutiya hai\" and fuck about. I asked a university functionary (leading private university in Manipal, Udupi - should be obvious now)  for a laptop that was part of the tuition fees, two months after my programme started. Got a lot of flack for speaking up. We\\'re being systematically trained to closet our thoughts. Will never happen because this atmosphere rarely changes at home. That is where this habit is learned and festered. Your default Indian cultural teaching is: Respect your elders (The no matter what is left unsaid) That really bad, if i was shouted at by my manager i should think how bad it feels and shouldn’t do it when i become manger , i dont know why people become their manager who starts shouting at other just cz they were shouted at.\\n\\nI have been a team lead and a Manager, i can honesty say i have always i have treated  my teammates how i wanted be treated by my seniors and always supported them. \\n\\nAnd employees are not slaves , you only pay them for the work they do for you and u dont own them . \\n\\nI have seen a guy who was acting manager who was shouting at in his friends company , complaining about being shouted at by his manager  where he actually worked for salary . The hypocrisy that\\'s indeed the case most of the times.\\n\\na lot of \"millennials\" and younger folk do indeed treat folks younger than us, folks in retail jobs & traditionally \"low profile\" jobs (like Security, Maids, Janitorial staff) with more respect than our parents did.  \\n\\nthere\\'s always the odd argument & disagreement - but it\\'s rarely based on \"class\" and \"status\".\\n\\nMost of the folks who are bosses, reporting managers & senior staff do consider work life balance, mental health & many such factors as well.\\n\\nhopefully the trend continues & we do indeed evolve to a better social atmosphere than one, from the years gone by. Never understood the ragging culture. No matter how small or insignificant the task is, it is not required to develop camaraderie. I\\'ve never been a part of it, and will never be a part of it. \\nIf I want to get the juniors to feel at home, I\\'ll invite them to a DnD session or some pubg/csgo and chill. The notion of a \"pecking order\" is deeply ingrained in our culture:  \\n\\n- The upper-caste is higher up the pecking order than the lower caste  \\n- Husband is higher up the pecking order than wife  \\n- Boy children are higher up the pecking order than girl children  \\n- Seniors (in office, in college, in cricket team) are higher up than juniors  \\n- etc.  \\n\\nThe person who is higher up is to be \"respected\", and the person who is lower down should expect to be yelled at and ill-treated.\\n\\nI believe that this is one of the major things about our cultural mindset that makes us fail to achieve our potential. The Indians who flee the country and achieve good things abroad (Nobel laureates, global CEOs) are the ones who are able to break free of this. Why does this ragging bullshit happen in this country. Bastards who studied at the institution for extra years think they have some sort of authority over others. This is SO needed in our society.\\nI went to a medical school, in case you do not know the way seniors treat juniors at medical or dental Institutions is horrifying. To make matters worse, professors are aware of all the activities that happen around. You were asked to complete assignments of seniors, run errands for them, entertain them, some girls would give in and date seniors to avoid being ragged & humiliated by others ( if you date a senior, it’s basically like a shield). My friends and I would avoid cafeterias and libraries so as to not run into anybody. You have to address every senior by sir or ma’am and wish them good morning or good evening each time you see them in the hallways. There were repercussions if not followed.\\n\\nAnyway, when we got to the second year we were so done with being treated like shit by our seniors. We decided to break the chain. Outta 100 from our class around 20 people were in and we did. By the time we graduated, ragging had diminished as new batches came in and it was reported to us seniors if at all anyone attempted anything. The juniors were no longer treated like slaves and people were genuinely helping each other out. There was no fear and juniors could actually hang out at the common areas.\\n\\nBut it wasn’t all roses, we were highly criticised and also humiliated by our own batch mates, seniors and professors for being responsible for the lack of “discipline” (intimidation) in the institution. We were told ragging and fear of seniors makes one respect them and it would give them a firm hand and authority till they graduate. I always hated being made to work late night or attend late evening calls.\\n\\nSo when I became a manager - no more meetings or calls after 6pm, and any work left after 6pm is deferred to next day.\\n\\nMy team is the worst performing team in the company apparently according to some qualitative parameters that My boss (director of firm) has in mind.\\n\\nMy team gets least of bonuses, and slowest promotions, but at least we live a good 9-6 life.

As of now I assume that it has to do with \\'engineering\\' the animals and their production systems to obtain the milk produces. I have cut out almost all meat and most dairy over the past few months, but I am trying not to put any labels on my diet. I still eat things like naan, bhature (both usually have dahi), many packaged snacks (often have milk solids, cheese powder, etc). I won\\'t say no to a good recipe with clams and mussels. if in future I have a sudden craving for meat, I will even have some seafood. Removing all animal products from diet may not be easy for everyone, but reducing consumption of meat and dairy by any amount certainly helps the planet and the animals. I am doing just the opposite. I sponsor the first restaurant non-veg meal of any vegetarian. So far managed to convert many people into this vibrant & delicious world of non-veg! I have been a vegan since October last year. This post is the epitome of why I hate the vegan culture. It\\'s not our place  to teach people the benefits of veganism or force-feed awareness. It might sound eccentric, but the more you force feed agendas to people. The more repulsed people get.

It was 90% there especially since our recipes involve lots of spices. But the cost was quite high.\\n\\nChai on the other hand is nowhere near decent with almond or oat milk. I will consider it when the vegan food becomes tasty, easy to prepare, widely available and affordable. I agree that going vegan is better for the environment. At a personal level, I think that the complete abstaining of meat and dairy makes the growth of vegan moment very slow. If we consider on just reducing our consumption, it can help a lot. That is never being talked about. 5 people reducing their meat and dairy consumption by 25 percent is more impactful than an individual going vegan I have recently started eating only meat once I saw the realities of the plant industry. Saw a video of a farmer butchering rice and paddy mercilessly. Plants being grown on soil deviod of nutrients and living a horrible life. Even though they can\\'t express pain in the same way as us, I can feel their suffering. I can\\'t stop eating completely so I am only eating animals for now.  I can no longer ignore plant suffering just because they are not as cute as animals.\\n\\nI have been trying to be more active and reach out to people and show them the ugly realities of plant cruelty and tofu industry.\\n\\nI\\'d be happy to talk to anyone who might even have the slightest interest in it or cares for plants even a bit. I love animals and I take in a lot of strays and feed them as well 🙈. I\\'m also vegetarian but I do consume egg and dairy 🙈. But I don\\'t go around telling everyone how to live their lives just because I follow a certain lifestyle 🙈. If anyone wants info on being vegan, a simple Google search will give them all the info they need 🙈. You just tell them its possible to get all nutrients in their budget from vegan source itself. That there is no need for animal meat or products. With evidence.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nAlso, if you are a vegan you should become a minimalist too.

Today most of India is sitting at homes in lock down condition, distancing from neighbours and friends. But sadly there is one aspect where the rules of distancing is not being followed. Yes, it is the very mundane and common activity, generally not noticed, not at all conspicuous and it is the activity of garbage collection. \\n\\nThe garbage collection in India is done in open bins wherein the sanitation workers collect the garbage from door to door. Then this garbage is transported in open trucks, many a times spilling a bit on the whole route taken by the vehicle. This is a surefire method of spreading the contamination while the whole nation is maintaining social distancing. May be the little bits of garbage here and there do not pose such a health hazard in normal conditions but during the Covid 19 pandemic, it poses a huge risk to all and most to the Sanitation Workers who are collecting the garbage, loading it on the trucks and driving those trucks.\\n\\nThe problem is dire in high rise apartments where door to door collection of garbage is done by Sanitation Staff or House Keeping staff in large garbage tubs which are perfunctorily covered with lids. These garbage tubs are taken up and down in lifts and elevators and the sanitation workers are confined all this time in the closed space with the garbage effusing all kinds odours and germs. God forbid if there is Covid -19 in any of the garbage.\\n\\nLong time back, India banned open carriage of night soil by the sanitation workers from open latrines because it was a health hazard for the sanitation workers and the surrounding areas. Today with Covid -19, collection and carriage of garbage in open is a larger contamination hazard. Therefore all wet and dry garbage from homes be collected in sealed bio-degradable garbage disposal bags and then transported in sealed garbage transportation vehicles for final disposal in land fills or incineration.\\nI request the Central Pollution Control Board to immediately put a stop to open bin collection and open truck transportation of garbage.   \\n\\nLet us drive away the ugliness from our roads and from the daily routine of the sanitation workers.

On 20th May the Indian summer monsoon will begin to envelop the country in two great wet arms, one coming from the east, the other from the west. They are united over central India around 10th July, a date that can be calculated within seven or eight days. Frater aims to follow the monsoon, staying sometimes behind it, sometimes in front of it, and everywhere watching the impact of this extraordinary phenomenon. During the anxious period of waiting, the weather forecaster is king, consulted by pie-crested cockatoos, and a joyful period ensues: there is a period of promiscuity, and scandals proliferate. Frater's journey takes him to Bangkok and the cowboy town on the Thai-Malaysian border to Rangoon and Akyab in Burma (where the front funnels up between the mountains and the sea).

However! It\\'s not in the way people think it did. \\n\\nExplanation - Markaz was a large gathering with plenty of people who returned from abroad. There were other , some even larger gatherings of people in delhi , guntur , Mumbai , indore etc the reason they did not cause a spike akin to that of the markaz incident is because of how ICMR had laid out plans to conduct testing at that time. \\n\\nThe only people being tested were people with a travel history and first contacts. This meant while everyone at the Nizamuddin fiasco got tested and tracked , literally almost no one from other large gatherings were tested. Which is why despite several congregations of people at different places which violated the lockdown at different times these were not attributed to an increase in infections. \\n\\nTldr 2\\n\\nMarkaz did lead to a spike in cases but it\\'s moreso because these people were tested specifically because of their history to have been potentially in contact with people who came from outside India not because Muslims have a higher affinity for the disease. \\n\\n\\nPs - important to note , shit like spitting on doctors and beating them is despicable. However , statistically muslims are bound to do that more often than other religions because they are a minority and hence have had problems with education and in general just being progressive, same with poor people.

       " 'similar situation here. Im a student. I found a hack recently. Instead of writing on pen/paper like the usual way. I started using a blackboard + chalk - and its more fun that way lol.  \\n\\n\\nSo heres the thing, change your work environment, sleep/chill in one room - work in another. Change your style of working. Just gotta shake it up! Used to be a freelancer working from home, so lots of experience doing this. It is not easy, but here are some tips that helped me and are helping me cope now when whole company is working from home:\\n\\n1. Make a separate workspace, preferably not near your bed. Keep sleeping area and working area separate and invisible from each other.\\n\\n2. Do your morning routine like you did when going to work. Get dressed for work. Pants not pyjamas - this is seriously the biggest difference for me.\\n\\n3. Use something like Tomato timer or Workrave, which reminds you to take a break in between. Get up, stretch, do some light exercises. \\n\\n4. If allowed in your city, go for a short walk or go to the terrace or anywhere that you can breathe fresh air for few minutes, in the middle of the work day. It\\'s very refreshing.\\n\\n5. Make coffee/tea breaks happen online with colleagues, with Google hangout with just audio if you have bandwidth issues. Chitchat is good. Try to talk about other stuff than Corona, actively and consciously. \\n\\n6. Talk to at least one human everyday. Not message but voice call or video call. Can be friends or family or whatever, just needs to be a human.\\n\\n7. Try to incorporate some fitness activity in your day. I\\'m very lazy and I tend to skip it, but in the days I do it, there\\'s more energy and efficiency overall.\\n\\n8. Plan your meals if possible, with something nice for lunch that you look forward to. Try to schedule it with a friend from work over video. It can be weird at first, but it\\'s nice actually to hear human sounds while eating.\\n\\nAnd lastly, don\\'t overburden yourself with expectation. Ignore all those \"motivational\" things about how if you don\\'t come out of lockdown with a new skill, better fitness blah blah stuff. This shit is hard. Everyone adjusts to it differently. The anxiety is real, even if nobody you know is sick. So if your productivity is lower, accept it rather than make excuses for it in your head and saying, I\\'ll make up for it tomorrow, failing and slipping into feeling worse. Hang in there my friend.\\n\\nEdited for formatting. You\\'re not alone!\\n\\nExact same situation here. I\\'m a web developer and affiliate marketer, haven\\'t been able to get anything done since this started. I\\'ve also lost all enthusiasm and will to achieve goals. Don\\'t worry, it\\'s completely normal to feel this way, these are crazy times.\\n\\nTry to make short term goals for yourself by dividing your work into short tasks, this helped me a little.\\n\\nAnd remember: [https://imgur.com/AyHqvcZ](https://imgur.com/AyHqvcZ) >in the past 2 days I haven\\'t written a single line of code\\n\\nMore like 10 days. I have clinical depression. An important part of learning to live with depression, in addition to medication and lifestyle changes, is to simply develop enough discipline to keep going, even if you don\\'t want to.\\n\\nForce yourself to sit down and get to bloody work, even if it frustrates you. The frustration will pass eventually.\\n\\nDealing with slumps is a natural part of building software. There is no magic fix. You just be a professional and do the damn job. Don\\'t sit and wait for enthusiasm to come back. Keep working even if you aren\\'t enthusiastic. Practice. Might be burnout. Remember to take breaks. Remember that you\\'re at home, your boss isn\\'t breathing down your neck, so you can take a few liberties, and work in an effective manner.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t finish household chores, they\\'ll keep weighing on your mind - go ahead and do simple chores during breaks in-between work.\\n\\nVariety helps in making people happy - try to change things up now and then. Even more so I have limited internet like with 2gb cap. After some video calls that\\'s done. So I don\\'t even have entertainment now. It\\'s just reporting work and then bitter boredom and decreasing productivity each and every day. I have this guilt that I\\'m wasting time but I\\'m not able to do anything Well. Think about the number of people around the world losing their jobs and wondering how they are gonna find another one while taking care of their commitments. And you are just being lazy and asking reddit about how you are not feeling good about working from the comforts of your home and still getting paid. Same boat, man. Everybody is being affected by this lockdown in different ways..\\nThese are unprecedented times, I sometimes feel like I am losing the will to live, like you I used to be disciplined and motivated,and I am one of the more fortunate & privileged ones.\\nHang in there it will be over soon.',\n",

       " \"> Interestingly India is filled with bhagwa but how the hell Pakistan(and middle east) is happy?\\n\\nWhy can't they be? Are you imagining Pakistanis staying awake at night imagining ways they can get Kashmir.\\n\\nSorry, I am just trying to understand the basis of assertion that Pakistanis can't be happier than Indians\\n\\nInterestingly they have consistently rated happier than Indians in last 3 years. They got happier while Indians got sadder https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Happiness_Report I believe they are taking the aggregate of people who vote their feelings from the respective countries. If a couple of Pakistan guys say they are happy and it's only those two guys who voted so far, whole Pakistan is shown green. I dont see why Pakistan shouldnt be happy. They have a reasonable PM and they are united in optimism for the country. Meanwhile in India societal tensions are at an all time high, media and news spread hate, fear, and division 24/7. We have just had an exhausting few months of negative news cycles with NRC/CAA protests and police brutality and then riots and killings in the capital. The economy was about to collapse even before corona. Exactly what do Indians have to be happy about at this stage? \\n\\nWatch Mark Wiens videos of traveling through Pakistan on youtube. It honestly seems awesome. I think humans being social creatures, nothing effects our unhappiness like tension and division in the community or the feeling that you don’t “belong”. Thats just my opinion though. I dont think these rankings mean much or they have a reliable methodology. But to answer ur question on Pakistan, they maybe basing it on this:\\n\\n\\n[Pakistanis happier than Indians, finds UN report on happiest nations](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/pakistanis-happier-than-indians-finds-un-report-on-happiest-nations-1482982-2019-03-20) This report might not have proper data but even if they did I would actually place them above india. India has a really high population of poor people who struggle to get by everyday. Even the lower middle class people working in IT and ITes companies have problems because they have to end up in big cities where they have to pay a shit ton of rent. I wouldn't be surprised if India ranks lower than the other countries of the subcontinent. You just have a very biased lense there are many reason Pakistanis rank higher then India most happiness reports... \\n\\n1) Less wealth gap, the poorest of Indians tend to be poorer then the poorest of Pakistanis\\n\\n2) relative peace, Pak went from having multiple bombs blasts a day in majority cities to maybe having one go off every 4-6 months.\\n\\n3) Optimism for the future, Pakistan has consistently been improving in most aspects for the past decade, people see the trend and are content. \\n\\nIndia on the other hand had great improvement but things have lately levelled off, optimism for the future isn't super high right now. \\n\\nI'd also add on a societal level India is going through a serious clash between secularism and not which has polarized society. \\n\\nSo all in all the avg Pakistani is optimistic for the future at this point in time, while the avg Indian is cautious about the future. And Pakistanis also tend to more practicing regarding religion and more religion tend to correlate with more happiness. \\n\\nPak may not better then India in any objective way it's just the way trends are moving is what brings hope and hope leads to happiness. Americans are happy?\",\n",

Can confirm the checks started happening way before in Mid Jan -early Feb types. Although selectively (hotspot countries) influx. Only for international travel, not sure if people here are confusing it with domestic. Lolll, I came to India from Hong Kong on the March 10th, they even missed me at the thermal screening coz it was so crowded and I kept seeing ppl slip in and out, and dodge the poor lady with a thermal reader ( and I swear she was not even looking at the reader all that much while this cursory check was done) and that’s about it, no body asked me to do a compulsory quarantine nada. \\n\\nAnd we all know those thermal readers are a bit pointless considering the virus can be in incubation for upto two weeks and worse loads of ppl could also be asymptomatic. \\n\\nThe only solution would have been to enforce a super strict quarantine measure for the retunees or best shut the airport down till this storm passed by. Instead we had rich idiots go to Uk and Italy up and till  the lockdown got announced and I am not even blaming them coz nobody was made aware of the severity of it.\\n\\nI mean everybody blames the TJ ppl for spreading this virus, but why the eff were they even allowed to have the seminar??

I deleted them after they decided to censor John Oliver. Doh!! Fabulous! Thank you for the PSA. Don't need to feel bad about spending on the subscription now. I've never seen it(save some clips here and there). It probably has 20-30 seasons right? Is it worth watching? Can I skip bad episodes/seasons without missing anything important? Thank you!!!

Naive question : If everyone is saying we are under reporting it and corona is running rampant in the population then why are we not seeing deaths or the medical system getting overwhelmed by this? We have been in lockdown for over 3 weeks now, if our situation was like Europe or US surely we would have noticed by now, even if government is under reporting? [Any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered by the word no .](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines) /s Lol. I honestly think we are doing quite well. TO conduct more tests we need more kits. Hopefully that will get fixed fast. \\n\\nBut govt shoots itself in the foot by messing around with CM-CSR funds and the PM/HM hiding behind bureaucrats. Not underreporting as much as under investigating. Take Mumbai for example. The mortality rate currently is about 7% for Mumbai and Maharashtra (much higher than the 0.5% to 2% range most scientists admit), this obviously means there are more confirmed cases that have been unaccounted for Every single country is \"under reporting\". If they die of starvation, it isn\\'t a death due to covid-19. This is the same situation in New York since the beginning of March... Those who are showing the symptoms are just isolating themselves.... The companies who are making testing kits are selling it to high bidders. Test kits are limited which is a problem and I think the government is trying to address it.  \\nIf they are not testing the relatives of people who may have died of covid-19 then I guess they determined that some other people are more suspicious and require testing. The dream scenario would be that everyone gets tested but it is not currently possible for India. We just have to trust that doctors who are making the judgement call on who gets tested. The first person who died in UP was suffering from corona since Feb. He didn\\'t have any travel history and was kept in general ward when got admitted in Gorakhpur. The doctor test him after he died and found corona positive and he is not the only one. 4 more cases happen where people in quarentine died and then there report came that they are corona positive. \\n\\nThe first death reported 10 days back and now report came for his family members and friends and they found corona positive. Even doctors and nurses from Gorakhpur hospital also found corona positive.\\n\\nNot only this, in one of the village of UP, 15 monkey died mysteriously from pneumonia within 24 hours.

Both parties enjoy good time in the country rather than use that good time to prepare for worst time in future. Only when things go out of hands they start moving their hands. The main reason I think of this is politicians in our country are perfect at speaking to public and attract them but lack scientific and managerial skills. And that is also because of the democratic system where you have to convince people to vote you in power only then you can do something good. So in short even congress would have responded the same. \\nDoes not belong/follow to any political party and putting up a rational thought here. For sure, there would've been no thali and diya circus! No communal discord, and probably more transparency and better testing numbers I believe. Considering that the bhilwara model in rajasthan is the strictest, I'm sure congress would have done a great job lol them comments, how angry are you at feku that you guys are seriously praising congress I think they would have done the same thing officially, but there would be a plethora of exceptions for various people (religious gatherings, travel of poor, etc.) which would make the lockdown futile in the end. At least they would have done better interactions, like regular press conferences and health updates. The party has some institutional experience of administration, having run various state and the central government over the years. While this brings the complacency that leads to things like scams and inherent corruption, this also puts in place a more well oiled structure of government operation. So the bureaucracy and the leadership connect better and don't have a steep learning curve of how to move things through the system when decisions need to be quickly taken. The leadership also has some veterans who have deep roots in the communities. So if cooperation of the communities is needed, they know how to pull the strings quickly. Congress is accused of appeasement politics i.e. showing favour towards minority groups which other people find unfair. However, what they don't do is actively spread extreme hatred. Which means that there is still some open connections with the groups who feel they are not well looked after, and in times like these its easier to bring them back to the table. You may see some of this being reflected in how the CMs of Rajasthan and Chattisgarh are handling the situation. The bureaucracy and their staff out on the streets need a leadership that will help them make sensible decisions, will listen to them, and not increase hostility that makes things difficult overall. I don't think they would have been able to take the stringent calls that this government has. The only person i could think of that would have done the same is chidambaram. No way a Gandhi at the helm would have been anything but a disaster. Modi has arrived late with the lockdown, but with an iron fist. That iron fist part would be the telling difference between Dear Leader and the Congis. Congis would surely have made a hash of it, and allowed the infection to spread.\",\n",

The data would have stayed on the users device and if and when they got infected, only then it would be uploaded to the server. I believe same was done in the case of TrueTrace the Singapore governments app. But after arogya setu was lunched we stopped working on it with the belief that when there are more apps on the market, it will hamper the tracing rather than aiding to it. \\n\\nThat being said, only tracing Bluetooth contacts is enough for detecting possible infections. For figuring out places where people might have chances of infection, government can use the location history export from maps of a infected person or simply ask the infected person about the places they visited. By obtaining that list govt. could easily notify people about possible risk of infection to people who have visited these places during this time. This way there is no need of tracking the location of each individual app user and the data remains in users hand. \\n\\nBut as the govt app is out now, many team\\'s who were working on the same might have already dropped the work citing similar reasons.

Uses Bluetooth pinging to check for a close proximity to an actual patient provided he also had the app installed. So it\\'s only effective if most of the population has it installed.\\n\\n2. Uses GPS information to tell the user if he had been in a designated hot spot.\\n\\n3. Every mobile is assigned a UID and it keeps a record of all UIDs who were in within the Bluetooth range (~10m). If an UID is found positive later, then all the UIDs who have been in close proximity to the positive UID will get a notification.\\n\\n4. Makes contact tracing process much faster .\\n\\n5. Data is wiped off from the servers after 30 days at the moment. This is based on the ICMR directions but it something that can change as their directives change. \\n\\n6. **MakeMyTrip founder says, that you are free to delete the app and you should definitely delete the app once Covid-19 blows over**.

I went to Amritsar back in mid January, couple of days later I had dry throat that resulted me coughing a lot and then fever, took medicines for 3 days and it went away for 5-6 days. Then it came back but whenever the weather was cold and no sun outside, it was so severe that my throat started hurting, I couldn't sleep at night due to dry throat. A week or so later, the weather became hot and it went away around end of February and begining of march. I would sit with international travelers every day during commute and in early Feb had severely hoarse voice, cough and severe body ache to the point I would gasp and cry out of pain in the washroom. My thermo was broken I suspect because I also felt unusually chilly and fatigued but it showed low temp (it had did so in Jan with another family member). I came out of it by being relaxed and enjoying a very important assignment I was given and using my hoarse voice to get things done fast! Yep. Just days before my Boards began on, I had fever as high as 39 C and early on-set of pneumonia with breathlessness. Got admitted into hospital on 24th of Feb and got discharged all within a day.

       " 'Published 3 days back. Reposting in light of speech from PM.\\n\\n\\n>The largest lockdown in history arrived with a four-hour notice. At 8 p.m. on March 24, Narendra Modi, the prime minister of India, appeared on television for the second time in a week to announce that starting at midnight the entire country was going to be effectively curfewed to slow the spread of COVID-19. A land as populous and tightly peopled as India can become a feast for a disease that thrives on human proximity. Modi’s decision was necessitated by mounting casualties in countries with health care vastly superior to India’s and proliferating warnings of impending calamity by experts at home.\\n\\n\\n\\n>His decisiveness appears to have yielded some success: As of April 10, there were 6,039 active cases of COVID-19 and 206 fatalities. (Although since there is no mass testing—fewer than 43,000 samples were tested by the end of March—and because the symptoms of the disease are not often apparent, there may be many more unreported cases.) This success, however, is braided together with a great deal of misery that could, with some preparation, have been mitigated—if not averted altogether. The sudden exodus of millions of Indians eking out an existence in the cities to distant villages across India bespeaks the malign incompetence of a prime minister who, despite being in command of enormous resources, squandered crucial weeks.\\n\\n>Consider the sequence of events. The first COVID-19 case in India was reported on Jan. 30. Yet as late as March 13—two days after the World Health Organization had declared the outbreak a pandemic—a senior official in the health ministry was assuring Indians that coronavirus is not a health emergency. India was one of the first countries to ban flights and bar travelers from China. But the appearance of alertness concealed inertia: It wasn’t until March 19 that the government ordered a halt on most exports of lifesaving equipment. An inventory of what was available, made public three days later, revealed the extent of the government’s negligence in the crucial weeks when the global march of the virus had become unstoppable. There were only 40,000 respiratory systems in a country of more than 1.3 billion people, one isolation bed for every 84,000 people, one doctor for every 11,600 patients, and one hospital bed for every 1,826 Indians.\\n\\n>Modi’s response was mystifyingly relaxed even as the perils of delaying action were becoming apparent in the tragic experiences of other countries. In the last week of February, he hosted a state visit for U.S. President Donald Trump. Its wasteful extravagance was worthy of the Kims of North Korea: Dozens of families living in shanties were served eviction notices and a wall was hastily erected to conceal them from presidential view. In March, Modi devoted his energies to toppling the government of Madhya Pradesh, the central Indian state governed by the opposition Indian National Congress party. Because the prime minister does not take questions from the press—he has not held a single real press conference in his six years as prime minister—it is impossible for those outside his impenetrable circle of confidants to ascertain his thinking. When it was announced finally that Modi was going to address the nation at 8 p.m. on March 19, panic swept through a country that was still recovering from the prime minister’s previous big 8 p.m. speech—in 2016—when he abolished 86 percent of all currency notes in circulation, plunging the country into chaos and precipitating the worst unemployment crisis in decades.\\n\\n>This time, however, Modi was soberer. He asked Indians to observe a “people’s curfew” during the day on Sunday, March 22, and applaud those working in front-line services—doctors, nurses, security personnel—in the evening. Most Indians obeyed his request and remained indoors. In the evening, however, many poured into the streets to celebrate. There were fireworks and festivities in some cities. Celebrities with large fan bases applauded Modi’s “masterstroke” and spread the myth that the virus was going to be vaporized by the “reverberations” of mass clapping. In 2014, the year Modi first entered office, India had placed a satellite in Mars’ orbit. The existence now of a market for the risibly anti-scientific piffle peddled by Modi’s admirers speaks to the depressing intellectual decline of the country. The curfew culminated in a farce. Still, given the unprecedented nature of the crisis, it was possible to give the benefit of the doubt to Modi: He was perhaps taking stock, buying time, and utilizing that time to mobilise India.\\n\\n>It was only after Modi announced a nationwide lockdown on the evening of March 24 that it began to dawn upon Indians that there was no plan. Modi was repeating what he had done in 2016. He was improvising, gambling, performing the French art of on s’engage, et puis on voit: first engage, then figure things out. Modi told Indians on March 19 that he had already created a special task force to mitigate the economic distress that the coronavirus would invariably provoke. He had done no such thing: Among those who had not heard of the task force’s existence until that moment was India’s finance minister—the person who, according to Modi, was supposedly chairing it. The first budgetary allocation for all of India’s emergency health care needs—$2 billion, or roughly $1.50 for every Indian—was also announced on March 24, 54 days after the first case was detected in the country. The first orders for the production of personal protective equipment for front-line health care workers were made hours before the announcement of the lockdown. The economic stimulus and relief package promised by Modi did not arrive for another two days. And when it did, it was the paltriest of all the big economies in the world: $22.6 billion—less than 1 percent of India’s gross domestic product—more or less the same amount earmarked by Modi to remodel the capitol in New Delhi. Rather than scrap this vanity project, the prime minister who spent more than $640 million in taxpayer money on publicity in his first term in office cleared it days before the lockdown.\\n\\n>What passed for the emergency aid package was for the most part a rescheduling of preexisting cash and food grant arrangements to poorer citizens. The union government in New Delhi will pay only a small share of the expense; much of the money will come from state governments. Left out altogether from its purview are the estimated 45 million migrant workers: the men and women who serve the needs of first-world India’s inhabitants as chauffeurs, servants, cleaners, cooks, and construction hands. This oversight may have been the result of carelessness rather than callousness. But that distinction means nothing to the millions of Indians who find themselves abandoned by the state and left to starve. All of India’s entrenched inequities—of caste, of wealth, of religion—have been on vivid display since the lockdown was announced. The chief justice of India, petitioned by activists urging him to direct the government to pay the wages of stranded migrants, wondered why they needed wages when they were being fed. The lack of thought has led to chaos and severe shortages. Trucks have piled up on the roads. Even the supply chain of medicines has been disrupted.\\n\\n>Contrast the feeble planning that preceded the enforced isolation of 1.3 billion people with the attention that went into burnishing the cult of Modi once the lockdown came into effect. Even though a disaster relief scheme to collect donations from the public has existed for decades, the prime minister created an opaque new charitable trust—christened the Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund to create the abbreviation “PM-CARES”—on March 28 and began soliciting contributions for it. Emergency supplies have been glazed with Modi’s face. And the prime minister’s office proceeded to produce a series of slick short films in dozens of languages—including Italian, Russian, and Mandarin—in which a slim, animated avatar of Modi is shown performing yogic calisthenics. Staff at foreign embassies in New Delhi have been invited to relieve stress by doing “Yoga with Modi.” This isn’t the first time Modi has deployed crude propaganda in a moment of mass panic. In 2013, when he was the chief minister of Gujarat, his office publicized the “rescue and relief operation” supervised personally by Modi to evacuate 15,000 pilgrims stranded in the foothills of the Himalayas. The Times of India eulogized Modi as India’s “Rambo” and praised his “trademark style of micro-management.” The entire story was a fabrication.\\n\\n>The coronavirus has struck India at a time when social cohesion is at its weakest in decades. The reservoirs of inner strength societies draw from in times of crisis were depleted in India on surviving the crises engineered gratuitously by Modi over the past six years. India’s minorities, especially its Muslim community, have every reason to look askance at a sectarian establishment that has sought to portray them as a fifth column and pushed legislation they fear could render them stateless. The civic conditions necessary to mount a public-spirited campaign have been shredded by the exclusionary policies pursued by Modi’s Hindu-first Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).',\n",

Pretty much every international summer student program (like the one by CERN) are conducted exclusively in English (maybe you'll be assigned to work with folks from your home country and can talk to them in your language, but the official language of the program is English).

       " 'Excerpts from Ambedkar’s final speech in the Constitution Assembly:\\n\\n\\n“…however good a Constitution may be, it is sure to turn out bad because those who are called to work it, happen to be a bad lot. However bad a Constitution may be, it may turn out to be good if those who are called to work it, happen to be a good lot.\\n\\n…The Constitution can provide only the organs of State such as the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary. The factors on which the working of those organs of the State depends are the people and the political parties they will set up as their instruments to carry out their wishes and their politics.”\\n\\n——\\n\\nOn dangers of putting creed over nation:\\n\\n“…not only India has once before lost her independence, but she lost it by the infidelity and treachery of some of her own people.”  \\n\\n“Will history repeat itself? It is this thought which fills me with anxiety. This anxiety is deepened by the realization of the fact that in addition to our old enemies in the form of castes and creeds we are going to have many political parties with diverse and opposing political creeds.\\n\\nWill Indian place the country above their creed or will they place creed above country?\\n\\nI do not know. But this much is certain that if the parties place creed above country, our independence will be put in jeopardy a second time and probably be lost for ever. This eventuality we must all resolutely guard against. We must be determined to defend our independence with the last drop of our blood.”\\n\\n——\\n\\nOn using constitutional means to achieve goals:\\n\\n“If we wish to maintain democracy not merely in form, but also in fact, what must we do? The first thing in my judgement we must do is to hold fast to constitutional methods of achieving our social and economic objectives.\\n\\nIt means we must abandon the bloody methods of revolution. It means that we must abandon the method of civil disobedience, non-cooperation and satyagraha.\\n\\nWhen there was no way left for constitutional methods for achieving economic and social objectives, there was a great deal of justification for unconstitutional methods. But where constitutional methods are open, there can be no justification for these unconstitutional methods. These methods are nothing but the Grammar of Anarchy and the sooner they are abandoned, the better for us.”\\n\\n—\\n\\nOn hero worship or Bhakti in politics: \\n\\n“There is nothing wrong in being grateful to great men who have rendered life-long services to the country. But there are limits to gratefulness, as has been well said by the Irish Patriot Daniel O’Connell, no man can be grateful at the cost of his honour, no woman can be grateful at the cost of her chastity and no nation can be grateful at the cost of its liberty.\\n\\nThis caution is far more necessary in the case of India than in the case of any other country. For in India, Bhakti or what may be called the path of devotion or hero-worship, plays a part in its politics unequalled in magnitude by the part it plays in the politics of any other country in the world. Bhakti in religion may be a road to the salvation of the soul. But in politics, Bhakti or hero- worship is a sure road to degradation and to eventual dictatorship.”\\n\\n—\\n\\nOn social democracy:\\n\\n\\n“Political democracy cannot last unless there lies at the base of…social democracy. What does social democracy mean? It means a way of life which recognizes liberty, equality and fraternity as the principles of life…\\n\\n…They form a union of trinity in the sense that to divorce one from the other is to defeat the very purpose of democracy …\\n\\nWithout equality, liberty would produce the supremacy of the few over the many.\\n\\nWithout fraternity, liberty would produce the supremacy of the few over the many.\\n\\nWithout fraternity, liberty and equality could not become a natural course of things. It would require a constable to enforce them.”\\n\\n—\\n\\nOn creating a national identity:\\n\\n\\n“If the people of the United States could not feel that they were a nation, how difficult it is for Indians to think that they are a nation. I remember the days when politically- minded Indians, resented the expression ‘the people of India.’ They preferred the expression the ‘Indian nation.’\\n\\nI am of opinion that in believing that we are a nation, we are cherishing a great delusion. How can people divided into several thousands of castes be a nation?\\n\\nThe sooner we realize that we are not as yet a nation in the social and psychological sense of the world, the better for us. For then only we shall realize the necessity of becoming a nation and seriously think of ways and means of realising the goal.\\n\\nThe realization of this goal is going to be very difficult – far more difficult than it has been in the United States. The United States has no caste problem. In India there are castes…But we must overcome all these difficulties if we wish to become a nation in reality. For fraternity can be a fact only when there is a nation. Without fraternity, equality and liberty will be no deeper than coats of paint.”\\n\\n—\\n\\nOn responsibility:\\n\\n“…let us not forget that this independence has thrown on us great responsibilities. By independence, we have lost the excuse of blaming the British for anything going wrong. If hereafter’ things go wrong, we will have nobody to blame. Except ourselves… \\n\\n…If we wish to preserve the Constitution in which we have sought to enshrine the principle of Government of the people, for the people and by the people, let us resolve not to be tardy in the recognition of the evils that lie across our path and which induce people to prefer Government for the people to Government by the people, nor to be weak in our initiative to remove them.\\n\\nThat is the only way to serve the country.

Identify their claims.\\n\\nThen use your knowledge of history and the context the piece is written in to scrutinise each claim. Go at it with a scalpel, so to speak. If you find yourself unfamiliar with the topics being raised and the themes being discussed, then start doing research on these topics.\\n\\nFor me personally both articles are largely full of hot air, and of not much significance outside of intellectual masturbation.\\n\\nWhile Taseer has a claim in that he has held PIO/OCI status for decades in spite of his Pakistani origin, it is also a fact that clerical error by the government is not an excuse to bestow unauthorised privileges to any individual ineligible for them.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Singh plays the \"what about Pakistan and the UK\" card, aka *tu quoque* or the appeal to hypocrisy fallacy to discredit Taseer\\'s claims. After all, India\\'s actions should be reactionary to what Pakistan or the UK are doing and there are no better standards than these two countries if we do have to compare. I don\\'t think an op-ed should lead you to form your mind on anything. If that was the case then Aatish Taseer\\'s post is more articulate, less hateful and obviously more credible. \\n\\nEvaluate the facts, and let your own sentiments guide you. Do you agree or disagree with the people who are saying these things and if so, why ? Considering the hit piece on Aatish reads like a  juvenile retort with shit like \\n\\n> Aatish Taseer is both Indian and Pakistani and neither; neither Hindu nor Muslim, but also both; colored, immigrant in the West; an exotic dream of all the feminists; male and female; of every democracy where universities are factories for pumping out legions of Social Justice Warriors.\\n\\nI don\\'t see any reason to take it seriously. I read both pieces. The first one is a slightly emotional but very valid criticism of recent Indian policy. The second one is a hitpiece that doesn\\'t really offer any solutions, just says a bunch of things about the author, brings up pakistani jihad and marxism and then basically says to the author \"oh the indian government treated you badly because you\\'re muslim? too bad, get used to it, India is HINDU now and people like you are going to be trod underfoot by people like me\".\\n\\nI honestly don\\'t see how you can read both pieces and think they\\'re equivalent.\\n\\nAs a word of advice, when reading stuff like this, take the Author\\'s sentiment, and carry it to it\\'s logical conclusion. What would a world that was run by the author, based on what he has written look like? What policies is he advocating for? What does he want to change? What will he keep the same? Would I want to live in that country? Would my friends want to live in that country? Who does the author consider enemies? Why? Who does he consider friends? Why? \\n\\nTry and hold those questions in your mind when reading anything remotely political. You\\'ll soon start to see some pretty clear patterns and begin to understand who you agree with and who you disagree with.\\n\\nPersonally Harbir Singh sounds like a flog who talks a lot and uses big words he doesn\\'t understand in an attempt to sound intelligent. He doesn\\'t really offer any solutions at all. You can quickly see that he considers anyone left of him to be an enemy of not just himself, but the nation as a whole. He also considers india a hindu nation and has no time for muslims, minorities or anyone else who may disagree. His \"friends\" are in the government and the establishment. The country he wants to see is one that has a single religion, maybe two if you allow for sikhism.\\n\\nYou don\\'t need an in depth knowledge on politics to understand whether or not you like that outcome.\\n\\nBut look up the political compass questionnaire and do it. You\\'ll get an idea of where you stand. So I read both pieces. We can definitely dive deep into both articles and present various points. But I will just share 1 observation. The movement that the left is fighting for is against real victims who are actually suffering the discrimination in their societies, their workplaces.\\n\\nThe second article on the other hand presents the white man, hindus, zionists as systematic victims which is an entirely false narrative. Sure they will give examples of terrorists in the US and India where they are the victims, but that\\'s the result of fringe groups. They aren\\'t victims of the system. Hence the entire argument falls flat because of the so called \"bogeyman\" that\\'s coming for these privileged groups.\\n\\nJust my opinion I don\\'t know about the aatish taseer guy, but the toi blog is hilarious.\\n>And then it all went wrong. Having won most of everything it fought for, but unable to be in any state of mind except one of self-righteous outrage against the evil of the oppressor, decided that justice wouldn’t be achieved till the Evil White Man was be destroyed, along with his history, his culture, his place of honor in the fabric of the world. Bring on the immigrants. Bring on Muslims. Bring on every colored person from everywhere in the world, however they can make it. Fill the west with them, bury the White Man’s society and the world he built, bury it under the swarm of foreign cultures who will never agree on anything among themselves except to be allowed to keep coming, and to take whatever opportunities of money and power that can be taken from the white man.  \\nDemocracy has been turned into the ultimate weapon to destroy the societies that birth democracies. The strategy is simple, import so many people who’ll have the vote but will not subscribe to the White Man’s culture, history, or values, and will simply vote them out of existence.\\n\\nWell what do you know, this guy is a white nationalist. Even fox news would be hesitant to publish this.\\n\\n>Aatish Taseer, Arundhati Roy, these are all limousine Marxists. For whatever Marx got right, what he got wrong was that the working class has no identity, or should have no identity, other than an economic one: Labor. This lays the seed of a “secular” ideology that is different from the Secularism enshrined in the American Constitution.  \\nAmerican secularism is the separation of Church and State. But where it protects the state from Religious Law, it also protects freedom of belief and conscience from persecution or manipulation by the state. That is true secularism. Marxist secularism however does not seek a separation between belief and state. The Marxist ideal is an ideological state, and the ideology tolerates no rivals. While the Marxist working class rights origins of the Left have disappeared, Marxism has mutated and switched from economics to culture. Now the ideology is that the Christian White men, Hindu Nationalists and Zionists are the oppressors, and their victims are righteous in uniting in revolution.\\n\\nAnd as always, these people haven\\'t read marx but like to think they know everything about him. As far as I know, arundhati roy is a social democrat and aatish taseer is a liberal, none of them espouse marxism. Looks like this guy has been reading those \"cultural marxism\" conspiracies out there.\\n>The Marxist DNA of Oppressor and Oppressed has jumped from the soul of the Soviet Union over to the West following the fall of the Berlin Wall.\\n\\n[Oppressor vs oppressed is an explicitly non-marxist way of thinking](https://libcom.org/library/gaspar-miklos-tamas-telling-truth-about-class). Marx doesn\\'t look at capitalism as a caste system where evil rich people steal from virtuous poor individuals, but rather as a system where capital kind of takes on a life of its own and where someone being a capitalist only really means that they are a \\'conscious representative\\' of the logic of capital flow. From Capital Vol 1:\\n\\n>\"...looking at things as a whole, all this does not, indeed, depend on the good or ill will of the individual capitalist. Free competition brings out the inherent laws of capitalist production, in the shape of external coercive laws having power over every individual capitalist.\"\\n\\nso it\\'s not like the capitalist class are an oppressing group that imposes their will on the oppressed proletariat, but instead both are subject to the logic of the system itself. Article one points to a problem. Article two is an ad-hominem on the author of article one. Which one do you think you should lean on?

But all said and done, sometimes the question is not about logic really, it\\'s about what is moral. \\n\\nFirstly, there will be convincing arguments from *\"both sides\"*. The test for a good history piece is the way they deal with archives and sources. If you are trained at JNU or Cambridge or one of those well established centres, they will always quote their sources. If you go to that quoted document in say National Archives in Delhi, you will find that for sure. Not the case for the speculative ones. Hearing \"both sides\" means that you take a stand about which one is good and worth hearing out and which ones are not. Not that you give them equal value after hearing them.\\n\\n*Sources* are themselves very tainted. Unless if you are trained, you will at best have random things to say about sources. If you read a historian writing about a purana, or a sanskrit source, they know the context if they are trained for years in Sanskrit, and a fair idea of what things are common in those times and whether that purana exaggerates or not. And you can see that they don\\'t take their sources at face value. It\\'s pointless to say, \"It\\'s written here, so it must be true\". A good historian should be able to say whether something is believable or not depending on the way things were during that time and the way these sources are handed down to us.\\n\\nNext, you can check the *credibility* of accusations. If someone is saying stuff like \"liberal left naxal historians\", it is just vague at best because all those words mean very different things. In contrast, take : \"so and so person\\'s sources do not speak of pendrives, and it completely ignores the works on history of technology, does not speak of semiconductor based computer systems, and the author has no background as an engineer or a historian\". This is a sensible thing to say because it points out why something is baseless.\\n\\nNow to *\"biases\"*. Sure, everyone has a point of view and narrative which they write as history. But are they considering evidence properly? Are they trying to be logical? Or they just saying, \"I wish it were like this, so let me just fabricate it all as if it\\'s all real\"? You\\'ll see that everyone has to do this to an extent, but you must ask : Are they trying to do an honest work, or just trying to fool me on hearsay? You\\'ll always find there are some good quality ones which stand miles ahead. And some that are just trash. \\n\\nI\\'ve had friends who come from hardcore RSS families and many others who are not. And, there are books or articles that say all sorts of things. But end of the day the question is, are you willing to hear someone just because they have a lot of political backing and agree that all Muslims are murderers? Or just because you want to take the side of a persecuted minority you\\'d be willing to say no Muslims are murderers? Good histories are not about these kind of polarising questions, because the answers are never yes or no. These are really stupid questions. It always depends on the time, the place, the politics, etc.\\n\\nA bit about *propaganda*. Try to see who is saying what and why. The RSS is founded with the Nazi inspiration and wants to create a Hindu Rashtra like European countries. And the BJP IT Cell is it\\'s frontline bastion is famously spreading fake news qs propaganda for the same. Apply any logic, and most of what they say turns to vapour. They\\'ll never explain their position step by step if you ask them, they\\'ll just say it\\'s true, and ask you to believe it or not, and blackmail you by saying you\\'re not a true Indian or Hindu if you don\\'t. I tried hard, but I just cannot trust them. They are full of hate, and do name callings like \"Pakistani agent\", \"pseudo intellectual\", etc, and that\\'s all they have to explain as their arguments. \\n\\nThere are other histories that are way better written. If you ask them why they are saying something, they\\'ll have a step by step explanation for that. Some explanations are bad, some are good. But there\\'s at least a discussion there.\\n\\nIn the end, you\\'ll believe what you want to. You\\'ll read what you want to. But, what is the kind of society you want to be in? Do you want to be a close minded person who never read \"Left naxal paid pakis\" and base your entire ideology on hating them? Do you want to rather hear opinions for their credibility and logic to pick what you\\'d like more? Would you rather focus on caste and class inequalities and dismiss all these as liberal nonsense? Would you rather focus on gendered discrimination and not bother to think of all these other debates as much? It\\'s upto you.\\n\\nIn our times, when things are so overpoliticised, historical validation is not even a necesary question to take a stand. As in, you\\'re lying to yourself if you say well let me hear both. Even if at some point some (Upper Caste hetero) Hindus were persecuted by some Muslims, are you okay with killing Muslims now? Or vice versa? Is it okay to send armed police men with grenades into unarmed girls hostels at night? Is it okay to revoke an OCI card of someone of Indian descent, just because he doesn\\'t like the Government? Here, it becomes a question of conscience. The critic is crying out why Mr. Taseer is not criticizing Pakistan. The article Taseer wrote is about India. Taseer grew up in India and had Indian residency papers until recently. Why should he talk about Pakistan? Maybe he will if he writes an article about Pakistan. The critic is not addressing the points Taseer is raising but rather going on about leftists.\\n\\nIf your critic starts calling you some \"ist\", that is a minus point for him, because rather than address your argument, they place you in a group and then attack you with all the malice they have for that group. >\\tI’ve never thought much of Aatish Taseer.\\n\\nYet you came up with a poorly-written essay on him.',\n",
